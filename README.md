# Real-time-Domain-Adaptation-in-Semantic-Segmentation
Project for the course of Machine Learning and Deep Learning at Politecnico di torino. Supervisors: Barbara Caputo, Antonio Tavera

Abstract:
One of the main challenges in semantic segmentation
is retrieving a large and high-quality labeled dataset to train
and test your model. As a matter of fact, real world datasets
have to be manually annotated, thus undermining the entire
development of convolutional neural networks for this task.
In this context, it is necessary to exploit synthetic datasets to
train our model, which are automatically annotated. In this
paper, we address the domain shift problem proposing a domain
adaptation technique based on unsupervised adversarial learning,
paired with a real-time network architecture. Our solution tries
to both narrow down the gap between the two domains and
speed up the inference model in a self-driving car scenario.
Different architectures for the discriminator are explored and a
thorough analysis and comparison among different compression
and optimization techniques (such as pruning, dropout, weight
sharing) has been carried out to find the best model.
